# DSC-DSU | Python Bootcamp 2020 | Week 1

Assignment 1:
A stright forward code to print a user inputted string diagonally.
I used a pretty bland method of multiplying an iterated variable to create the effect, 
another fuction in the file prints the function reverse diagonally.
Assignment 2:
The purpose of the assignment was to print a table of number of students entered by the user.
I used the re module to add some validity checks to the user inputted values.
Apart from that 
QUESTION: I had some trouble with the variable I was iterating with (x) as if I declared it in the  main function it was not available to the other functions, and hence I had to declare it globally.
Assignment 3: 
We had to write a program that would print the lyrics to our favourite song after a specified time delay. Although we were adviced to use string's .split function I used the .splitline function due to prefernce. The song I chosewas Atif Aslam's Aadat(proud member of the broken hearts club).

Post Scriptum: Thanks for providing this amazing oppurtunity to learn, I am loving the course so far and hopefully it will get even better as the days progress. (Really hoping you guys find the easter egg present in the assignments.)
